He reached his manager due to budget cut.He had to finish the travel plan in less cost possible.His manager used these heuristics available in Google OR-tools to determine the optimal route to decrease travel cost and save money for the travel with the help of Connecticut Data.We assume the cost of travel is same as the distance covered by the Salesperson who travels at constant speed."
